<h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Was established in 1978</h5>
<p class="text-muted">Your school is the institution you owe so much to. As a child you enter into school in kindergarten, and it is your teacher who teaches you the alphabets and the numbers in class. Year after year as you grow up and complete class after class you keep on learning, assimilating knowledge and developing a well-rounded personality.

  You also become more and more capable and equipped to do your duties and responsibilities as a good citizen and fine human being. Your teachers at school teach you with a great deal of care and concern and patience. When you are through with school, you are grateful to your school and all the teachers who shaped and moulded you into what you become. And you always carry fond memories of your alma mater.</p>

<h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">was built in 1982</h5>
<p class="text-muted">A school auditorium is a central unit for addressing students, lectures, and gymnasium practices. The size of the auditorium depends on the use, function, and strength of the total students in school. A well-designed auditorium must be capable of accommodating at least half the total number of students in school.</p>
